## IMPORTANT
This project is in early development, and no working version is yet released.  
This project stems from an earlier project by the same name, releases of that project may be found in the Releases section of the GitHub repository. However, that project was highly unstable and it's not recommended to use it, instead, wait for beta-v0.1 to release.  
Once beta-v0.1 is released, installation instructions and full documentation will be linked in this file.
